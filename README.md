# Students-Sleep-Fatigue-Relation
# Student Sleep and Fatigue Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between students' sleep patterns and fatigue levels. It includes data processing, visualization, and calculation of the Fatigue Severity Score (FSS) to assess how sleep affects student fatigue.

## Features
- Distribution analysis of sleep patterns over different years
- Evaluation of daytime naps and their impact on fatigue
- Calculation of Fatigue Severity Score (FSS)
- Data visualization and insights

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd studentssleep-fatigue-relation
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook studentssleep-fatigue-relation-main.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform data analysis.

## Methodology
- Data is processed and cleaned for consistency.
- FSS is computed by summing relevant survey responses.
- Visualizations help understand sleep-fatigue correlations.
